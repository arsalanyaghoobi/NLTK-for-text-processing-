# NLTK-for-text-processing-
we can not use raw data set as it is; a data set should be pruned and be processed in many different ways depending on the purpose and requirements; NLTK , to the extent of my knowledge, is among the best for this purpose.
Openning the PDF( Unfortunately I have no idea where is the code itself),it containes more detailed explanations which can be helpful.
